**Welcome to ml4beer, a place for discussion on the use of machine learning and data science within the craft beer industry.**

A successful craft beer combines design, art, science, marketing and operations. Many brewers exploit known recipes and traditions whilst others explore and experiment with new technologies and styles. All these areas can be supported with data science and machine learning technolgies can help to push the boundaries, make brewing operations more efficient and enhance the experience of consumers.

**Design, art, brewing science, marketing and operations are all areas we will explore and discuss in ml4beer.**

If you have used data science and machine lerning in developing beers or have any ideas and stories to share, please get in touch.
