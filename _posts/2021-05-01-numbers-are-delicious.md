In 2017, I was invited to stay with a friend in Adelaide. We spent alot of time visiting wineries and doing wine tastings around the Adelaide Hills and the Barassa Valley. At each winery, we sampled a limited set of wines that were on offer, either because the winery had too many to physically try or we were pacing ourselves for the day ahead. On occation, when I really enjoyed the wine and was affordable, I would buy a bottle to take home. I really enjoyed the experience of touring the different wineries but I often felt that I may have missed out on a great bottle due to our limited tastings at each venue.

Fast forward a couple of years, this time in Melbourne whilst on a worktrip, the same friend and I spend our weekends visiting different brewies around the city. We often started with a flight of beers, and based on our preferences, we would each buy a pint for the road. A couple of brewies in and our pace would begin to slow. We never once kept to the schedule we planed, ultimatly resulting in  many venues and beers being undiscovered.

On both occoations, I felt our approach to discovering new wines and beers was pretty inefficient. Although increadibly enjoyable, we spent a lot of time travelling to different venues and consuming a lot of alchohol before finding those that matched our preferences. We left a lot of drinks undiscovered that we would have enjoyed even more than those we spent our money on and took home.

More recently, whenever walking into a bottle shop, I find the choice overwhelming. Before buying a beer, my thought process is usually, choose a style, and then pick a beer that has been recommended by a friend, is highly rated or has a great name or label. When buying wine, I often just look for the one that has the right price. Neither of these appraoches is a great way to find a beer or wine that macthes my personal preferences.

Having a background in data science and machine learning, I wondered how we could use data about each product to help us make more informed choices and accelerate the process to dicovering new products. A big problem is that there is much more to beer than data and numbers. Quoting Garret Oliver (Brewmaster at Brooklyn Brewry), *"numbers are not delicious"*. Personal perception and experiences are fundamental to the enjoyment of drinking beer.

This led me down the path to investigate and develop an approach that can combine objective information about a beer (abv, bitterness units, gravity units etc) and subjective information that is personal to each individual.  

****

whats the point in IBU alone if percieved bitterness is impacted by the abv and balanced with sweetness. even more appropriate measures like BU/GUone would argue the best way to meaure the beer is to use your nose and tastebuds.

but unfortunetly not all of us have the luxyry to evaluate every beer and give a subjective view before we buy. I often find myself choosing a beer on its general style and label design (more often than not i find myself buying the most eye catching NEIPA)

but with such range across styles and within styles this cant be the best way to discover new beer.
